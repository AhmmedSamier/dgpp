// CollectiveBus: the M5 data plane (DESIGN §6). One bus per process owns
// every peer pair's RC QPs on every configured lane, the single-threaded
// engine loop that polls them (§6.1), per-class slot pools, and the
// watchdog-bounded receive consumers.
//
// Concurrency contract (§6.1): the engine thread owns all verbs objects,
// slabs, and slot/credit state. Other threads touch the bus only through
// send()/wait()/stop() — submissions go to per-class queues drained in
// priority order with bounded bulk posts, so concurrent latency-under-bulk
// traffic is a supported, tested mode. The class slot pools make the credit
// floors structural: bulk can never occupy a latency slot.

  // fences hold across eras verbatim. Session discipline: one forward
  // thread for arm/finish/eager submissions (the gates are coll_mu-
