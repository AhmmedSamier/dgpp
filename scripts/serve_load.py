"""Measure decode throughput at fixed concurrency against dgpp-serve.

Each phase sends concurrent streaming requests with distinct long-answer
prompts. Requests are greedy with thinking disabled unless overridden.
The report includes usage token counts, time to first visible output and
client update pace, plus request-wall throughput and the explicitly named
legacy output-span rate. SSE updates can carry several tokens.

Use --classes to run separate sweeps for prose, code, JSON, math and chat.
Use --temperature to measure sampled requests.

# The per-class corpus. Prompt 0 of every class is the same TEXT as that class in
# scripts/fabric_mtp_classes.sh, which has been the project's class corpus since
# 2026-09-05 and produced every published per-class table — so a concurrency-1
# phase here is comparable to those numbers rather than to a fresh set of words.
# Prompts 1..3 are of the same kind and exist only because a phase at
# concurrency c needs c distinct prompts: repeating one would share a decode
# path and attach to the prefix cache, and neither is what a class costs under
# load. check_corpus() below re-reads the shell script and fails if prompt 0 has
# drifted from it.
