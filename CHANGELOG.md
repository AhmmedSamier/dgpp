# Changelog

The history by milestone. The dated engineering record in
`benchmarks/results/` has every measurement and fix behind these lines;
`PLAN.md` has the milestones' exit gates.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-06

Productionizing: the model-agnostic code left the `glm` namespace
(`dgpp::serve`, `dgpp::sched`, `dgpp::sample`, `dgpp::text`; GLM under
`src/models/glm/`; the binary is `dgpp-serve`); one cluster config
(`deploy/cluster.json`, a site's copy of `deploy/cluster.example.json`)
read by the launcher and every rank, the head
pushing the world's settings to the peers over the journal before anything
builds; versioned releases (`scripts/release.sh`) installed once per node
(`dgpp-cluster install`), the version stamped into the binary and refused
across a mixed world; `scripts/dgpp-cluster` as the launcher.

The request contract gained `stop`, `n`, `logit_bias`, and the usage's
`cached_tokens` and `reasoning_tokens`. Every rank's log carries one
aggregate throughput line per 10 s; the per-tick lines moved to DEBUG.

## 2026-09-05 — M9 closed; M7 built; M6 and M8 buttoned up

- M9: the continuous op-stream drift check on every journal record; a
  malformed-HTTP fuzzer under AddressSanitizer (three defects found and
  fixed); the one-hour mixed soak; the operator's page; the sign-off report
  (32K TTFT, MTP acceptance per class, the prefix cache's capacity curve);
  the ranked next-steps list.
- M7: the exact snapshot prefix cache — decisions rank-identical in the
  scheduler, the snapshot arena in the engines, hot == cold bitwise.
- The v1 failure semantics built, gated and drilled with kill −9 on the
  four nodes; the strict tool grammar's key ledger; cancellation under the
  one-graph step gated.
- Prefill rounds 4–9: the bulk collective as a cooperative kernel with paced
  senders, the MoE experts on grouped tensor-core kernels, the attention
  prefill as a flash kernel; 256 tokens 0.58 s, 2,048 tokens 1.7 s.

## 2026-09-04 — the contract fills in

Tool calls and reasoning on the wire; constrained decoding as a guarantee
for `tool_choice` and `parallel_tool_calls`; `response_format` with JSON
schemas through the same masks; typed tool arguments; drain-on-stop;
grow-on-demand admission; exact sampling on the service with the on-device
verdict and its gather fallback; the sampling-width sweep; prefill rounds
1–3.

## 2026-09-03 — M8: transactional MTP; the on-device step

Greedy speculative decode with the checkpoint's MTP layer as one graph
replay per step, transcript identical to plain decode (31.3 → 22.45 ms per
token); the pick behind the head on the device; the adaptive scalar and
row-batched graph variants that removed the low-occupancy regression; the
kernels-only decode graph that closed the batched-MTP loopback stall; the
teacher-forced log-probability gate; fp32 logits.

## 2026-09-01 to 2026-09-02 — M6: generation, tokenizer, service

The incremental decode engine; the byte-exact tokenizer and the Jinja
chat-template interpreter; the deterministic scheduler; the
OpenAI-compatible service at world 1, then on the fabric behind the
admission journal; the decode step as a recorded graph with the
collectives as graph nodes; eleven optimization rounds on the T=1 step
(393 → 31.45 ms per token); the one-pass resident load and the per-rank
image cache (boot 15–25 s).

## 2026-08-29 to 2026-08-31 — M5: four-rank tensor parallelism

The RC/RoCE CollectiveBus with its slot pools, dual-lane striping and
watchdogs; the epoch-based roster; the sharded resident load; the fabric
TP=4 parity gate at real dimensions; the resident serving mode.

## 2026-08-27 to 2026-08-28 — M0 to M4

Platform, topology, transport and checkpoint facts; the core runtime, the
safetensors loader and the synthetic graph testbed; the KDA operators and
state manager; DSA/MLA sparse attention with its index pools; the
assembled 45-layer GLM forward with per-layer parity against torch
references.
